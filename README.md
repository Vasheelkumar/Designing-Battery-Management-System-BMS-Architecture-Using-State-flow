# Designing-Battery-Management-System-BMS-Architecture-Using-State-flow
Developed a comprehensive MATLAB-based Battery Management System (BMS) model utilizing Simulink and Stateflow to simulate real-time supervisory control logic,
charging/discharging operations, and safety mechanisms in EV battery packs.
•State of Charge (SOC) Estimation: Implemented accurate SOC estimation using Coulomb Counting techniques
